# Digits-Predictor-using-Scikit-Learn

# Description:

We have digits dataset from scikit learn library. Our objective of this project is to compare six supervised machine learning models using the Digits dataset and come out with the best model that accurately predicts the correct digit.

# Classifiers: 
                  
        1. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
        2. NAIVE BAYES
        3. DECISION TREE
        4. K NEAREST NEIGHBOR
        5. NEURAL NETWORKS
        6. STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCCENT
